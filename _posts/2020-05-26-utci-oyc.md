## A collaborative music and photography series
Created remotely in response to the global pandemic, this [Oh Yeah Cool](https://www.ohyeah.cool/blog-posts/ungoverned-transformation) series features [improvisational music](https://benoneill.bandcamp.com/album/ungoverned-transformation-constructed-improvisations) by artist [Ben O'Neill](https://benoneill.bandcamp.com/album/ungoverned-transformation-constructed-improvisations), presented with images from photographers currently living in Manhattan, Jersey City, and Philadelphia. The photographs tell stories of the vacillating emotional states caused by Covid-19, including photos from March 2020, just as the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic.


In Ungoverned Transformation [Ben O'Neill](https://benoneill.bandcamp.com/album/ungoverned-transformation-constructed-improvisations) used his voice on the guitar to construct improvisations inspired by ten photographs related to the quarantine period of 2020. Drawing as much from the hymns of American gospel music as the musings of French surrealist composer Erik Satie, Ben created pieces alternately reflective, eerie, cacophonous and calming. The improvisations were recorded over two days, taking direct influence from the corresponding images. The long-form visual presentation was produced by [Oh Yeah Cool](https://www.ohyeah.cool/blog-posts/ungoverned-transformation)

Conceived of as a mode of seeking kinship during a deeply unsettling time, Ungoverned Transformation has morphed into a way to provide some support to the most vulnerable among us. **All proceeds from direct sales on Bandcamp will be donated to Broad Street Ministry, a homeless shelter in Philadelphia that provides meals as well as medical, behavioral health, and reentry services to those in need.**
